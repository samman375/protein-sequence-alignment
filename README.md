# Protein Sequence Alignment Calculator

- Assignment completed in T3 2022 for BINF3020: Computational Bioinformatics
- Task was to create an amino acid sequence alignment calculator that given a number of sequences will calculate an optimal alignment score for each, using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
- Project Spec can be found in `spec.html`.
- A final mark of 92.9/100 (6.5/7) was awarded and was worth 9% of final grade.

## Example Usage

With a fasta file `s501` containting amino acid sequences:
```sh
python3 ./align1.py < s501 > a501
```
